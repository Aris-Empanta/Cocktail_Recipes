## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this app you can find the recipes of over 600 cocktails and beverages. It fetches 
all the information from the **Cocktail db api**. The reason I made this project, was to practise the consumption of third
party apis. Here are the tasks that a user can do in this app:

- Check cocktail recipes by first letter in alphabetical order
- Search cocktail by name
- Search cocktail by an ingredient name.
- Click the random GET COCKTAIL search, so that the app will fetch and render a random cocktail's recipe.
